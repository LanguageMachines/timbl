@article{Sang+13,
	Abstract = {As data sets keep growing, computational linguists are experiencing more big data problems: challenging demands on storage and processing caused by very large data sets. An example of this is dealing with social media data: including metadata, the messages of the social media site Twitter in 2012 comprise more than 250 terabytes of structured text. Handling data volumes like this requires parallel computing architectures with appropriate software tools.
In this paper we present our experiences in working with such a big data set, a collection of two billion Dutch tweets. We show how we collected and stored the data. Next we deal with searching in the data using the Hadoop framework and visualizing search results. In order to determine the usefulness of this tweet analysis resource, we have performed three case studies based on the data: relating word frequency to real-life events, finding words related to a topic, and gathering information about conversations. The three case studies are presented in this paper.
Access to this current and expanding tweet data set is offered via the website twiqs.nl.},

As short texts do not provide sufficient word occurrences, traditional classification methods such as "Bag-Of-Words" have limitations. To address this problem, we propose to use a small set of domain-specific features extracted from the author's profile and text. The proposed approach effectively classifies the text to a predefined set of generic classes such as News, Events, Opinions, Deals, and Private Messages.}},

	Abstract = {{Twitter is an electronic medium that allows a large user populace to communicate with each other simultaneously. Inherent to Twitter is an asymmetrical relationship between friends and followers that provides an interesting social network like structure among the users of Twitter. Twitter messages, called tweets, are restricted to 140 characters and thus are usually very focused. We investigate the use of Twitter to build a news processing system, called TwitterStand, from Twitter tweets. The idea is to capture tweets that correspond to late breaking news. The result is analogous to a distributed news wire service. The difference is that the identities of the contributors/reporters are not known in advance and there may be many of them. Furthermore, tweets are not sent according to a schedule: they occur as news is happening, and tend to be noisy while usually arriving at a high throughput rate. Some of the issues addressed include removing the noise, determining tweet clusters of interest bearing in mind that the methods must be online, and determining the relevant locations associated with the tweets.}},

	Abstract = {{Twitter presents a source of information that cannot easily be obtained anywhere else. However, though many posts on Twitter reveal up-to-the-minute information about events in the world or interesting sentiments, far more posts are of no interest to the general audience. A method to determine which Twitter users are posting reliable information and which posts are interesting is presented. Using this information a search through a large, online news corpus is conducted to discover future events before they occur along with information about the location of the event. These events can be identified with a high degree of accuracy by verifying that an event found in one news article is found in other similar news articles, since any event interesting to a general audience will likely have more than one news story written about it. Twitter posts near the time of the event can then be identified as interesting if they match the event in terms of keywords or location. This method enables the discovery of interesting posts about current and future events and helps in the identification of reliable users.}},

Current detection method is limited to facts part of messages. We developed an application called  '' Hotstream'' based on the proposed method. Users can discover breaking news from the Twitter timeline. Each story is provided with the information of message originator, story development and activity chart.

	Abstract = {{Government agencies must often quickly organize and analyze large amounts of textual information, for example comments received as part of notice and comment rulemaking. Hierarchical organization is popular because it represents information at different levels of detail and is convenient for interactive browsing. Good hierarchical clustering algorithms are available, but there are few good solutions for automatically labeling the nodes in a cluster hierarchy.This paper presents a simple algorithm that automatically assigns labels to hierarchical clusters. The algorithm evaluates candidate labels using information from the cluster, the parent cluster, and corpus statistics. A trainable threshold enables the algorithm to assign just a few high-quality labels to each cluster. Experiments with Open Directory Project (ODP) hierarchies indicate that the algorithm creates cluster labels that are similar to labels created by ODP editors.}},

In particular, a comparison with a state-of-the-art system on the first story detection task shows that we achieve over an order of magnitude speedup in processing time, while retaining comparable performance.

	Abstract = {{A common task in signal processing is the estimation of the parameters of a probability distribution function. Perhaps the most frequently encountered estimation problem is the estimation of the mean of a signal in noise. In many parameter estimation problems the situation is more complicated because direct access to the data necessary to estimate the parameters is impossible, or some of the data are missing. Such difficulties arise when an outcome is a result of an accumulation of simpler outcomes, or when outcomes are clumped together, for example, in a binning or histogram operation. There may also be data dropouts or clustering in such a way that the number of underlying data points is unknown (censoring and/or truncation). The EM (expectation-maximization) algorithm is ideally suited to problems of this sort, in that it produces maximum-likelihood (ML) estimates of parameters when there is a many-to-one mapping from an underlying distribution to the distribution governing the observation. The EM algorithm is presented at a level suitable for signal processing practitioners who have had some exposure to estimation theory}},

	Abstract = {{Twitter, a popular microblogging service, has received much attention recently. An important characteristic of Twitter is its real-time nature. For example, when an earthquake occurs, people make many Twitter posts (tweets) related to the earthquake, which enables detection of earthquake occurrence promptly, simply by observing the tweets. As described in this paper, we investigate the real-time interaction of events such as earthquakes in Twitter and propose an algorithm to monitor tweets and to detect a target event. To detect a target event, we devise a classifier of tweets based on features such as the keywords in a tweet, the number of words, and their context. Subsequently, we produce a probabilistic spatiotemporal model for the target event that can find the center and the trajectory of the event location. We consider each Twitter user as a sensor and apply Kalman filtering and particle filtering, which are widely used for location estimation in ubiquitous/pervasive computing. The particle filter works better than other comparable methods for estimating the centers of earthquakes and the trajectories of typhoons. As an application, we construct an earthquake reporting system in Japan. Because of the numerous earthquakes and the large number of Twitter users throughout the country, we can detect an earthquake with high probability (96\% of earthquakes of Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) seismic intensity scale 3 or more are detected) merely by monitoring tweets. Our system detects earthquakes promptly and sends e-mails to registered users. Notification is delivered much faster than the announcements that are broadcast by the JMA.}},

	Abstract = {{Twitter is a user-generated content system that allows its users to share short text messages, called tweets, for a variety of purposes, including daily conversations, URLs sharing and information news. Considering its world-wide distributed network of users of any age and social condition, it represents a low level news flashes portal that, in its impressive short response time, has the principal advantage. In this paper we recognize this primary role of Twitter and we propose a novel topic detection technique that permits to retrieve in real-time the most emergent topics expressed by the community. First, we extract the contents (set of terms) of the tweets and model the term life cycle according to a novel aging theory intended to mine the emerging ones. A term can be defined as emerging if it frequently occurs in the specified time interval and it was relatively rare in the past. Moreover, considering that the importance of a content also depends on its source, we analyze the social relationships in the network with the well-known Page Rank algorithm in order to determine the authority of the users. Finally, we leverage a navigable topic graph which connects the emerging terms with other semantically related keywords, allowing the detection of the emerging topics, under user-specified time constraints. We provide different case studies which show the validity of the proposed approach.}},

In this context, we studied the structural properties of a corpus of 5,835,237 Twitter microblogs, and found it to exhibit Power laws across space and time, much like those exhibited by events in multiple domains.

Although both the contents and time information of news articles are helpful to RED, most researches focus on the utilization of the contents of news articles. Few research works have been carried out on finding better usages of time information. In this paper, we do some explorations on both directions based on the following two characteristics of news articles. On the one hand, news articles are always aroused by events; on the other hand, similar articles reporting the same event often redundantly appear on many news sources. The former hints a generative model of news articles, and the latter provides data enriched environments to perform RED. With consideration of these characteristics, we propose a probabilistic model to incorporate both content and time information in a unified framework. This model gives new representations of both news articles and news events. Furthermore, based on this approach, we build an interactive RED system, HISCOVERY, which provides additional functions to present events, Photo Story and Chronicle.}},

	Abstract = {{New Event Detection is a challenging task that still offers scope for great improvement after years of effort. In this paper we show how performance on New Event Detection (NED) can be improved by the use of text classification techniques as well as by using named entities in a new way. We explore modifications to the document representation in a vector space-based NED system. We also show that addressing named entities preferentially is useful only in certain situations. A combination of all the above results in a multi-stage NED system that performs much better than baseline single-stage NED systems.}},

	Abstract = {{The reliable extraction of knowledge from text requires an appropriate treatment of the time at which reported events take place. Unfortunately, there are very few annotated data sets that support the development of techniques for event time-stamping and tracking the progression of time through a narrative. In this paper, we present a new corpus of temporally-rich documents sourced from English Wikipedia, which we have annotated with TIMEX2 tags. The corpus contains around 120000 tokens, and 2600 TIMEX2 expressions, thus comparing favourably in size to other existing corpora used in these areas. We describe the preparation of the corpus, and compare the profile of the data with other existing temporally annotated corpora. We also report the results obtained when we use DANTE, our temporal expression tagger, to process this corpus, and point to where further work is required. The corpus is publicly available for research purposes.}},

	Abstract = {In this paper, we describe a new approach for retrieval in texts with non-standard spelling, which is important for historic texts in English or German. For this purpose, we present a new algorithm for generating search term variants in ancient orthography. By applying a spell checker on a corpus of historic texts, we generate a list of candidate terms for which the contemporary spellings have to be assigned manually. Then our algorithm produces a set of probabilistic rules. These probabilities can be considered for ranking in the retrieval stage. An experimental comparison shows that our approach outperforms competing methods.},

                 were automatically classified and the error types
                 analyzed. The results, which were consistent over the
                 different databases, showed that the expected incidence
                 of misspelling is 0. 2\%, that 90-95\% of spelling
                 errors have only a single mistake, that substitution is
                 homogeneous while transposition is heterogeneous, that
                 omission is the commonest type of misspelling, and that
                 inadvertent doubling of a letter is the most important
                 cause of insertion errors. The more frequently a letter

                 Abstracts Service (CAS) extracted over 50,000
                 misspellings from approximately 25,000,000 words of
                 text from seven scientific and scholarly databases. The
                 misspellings were automatically classified and analyzed
                 and the results used to design and implement a program
                 that proved capable of correcting most such errors.
                 Analysis of the performance of the spelling error
                 detection and correction programs highlighted the
                 features that should be incorporated into a powerful
                 and user-friendly interactive system suitable for
                 nonprogrammers. These include document level thresholds
                 for mispelling detection, automatic reuse of user
                 decisions, and user verification and control of
                 correction. An advantage of the proposed design is that
                 the system automatically customizes itself to its
                 environment. This article is primarily concerned with

	Abstract = {This paper describes the ongoing development of a software spelling normalization system named ZENSPELL. It is intended to assign normalized, present-day English spellings to 18th spelling variants with minimal user intervention while keeping the source text intact and available for comparison. The article examines the possibility of adapting 18th century English newspaper texts in order to make them comply with 20th century spelling rules. The idea is to create a hybrid text: like glossed word-for-word &#039;translations&#039; of Latin texts, the target text will contain 18th century sentences, but with 20th century orthographic words. Despite somewhat doubtful linguistic qualities, the resulting &#039;artificial&#039; text will be useful for two purposes: first, lexical searches can be made using one normalized search term instead of having to guess possible spelling variations of the intended term. Second, the target text can be used as input for wordclass taggers such as ENGCG.},
